The data is generated from the NAMUS-National Missing and Unidentified Persons System with the search criteria set to search for historical records of all missing children in the US including all 52 states.</p>\n<p>The data is supplemented with geolocation data converted by Geocodio, integrated into a Mapbox tileset and visualized with Mapbox studio. The same dataset is used to generate the Age to Year Missing Graph with Gender colour legends and built with React and D3.</p>\n<p>To sign up as a web sleuth, users log into the app with their email and password. Users are then able to perform advanced searches through the database. Search result data is retrieved from the backend asynchronously with AJAX. With the generated results, users are able to securely add notes, save, update and delete their searches with sessions.</p>","frontmatter":{"github":"https://github.com/Debiday/The_Lost_Children","link":"http://lostchildren.deborahong.com/","stack":"Python, Javasript, React, Flask, HTML, SQLalchemy, postgreSQL, CSS, Mapbox, Geocodio","title":"The Lost Children","featuredImg":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/png;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f781b9da31acbdd9e803759f5c15d290/bdec0/lost-1.png","srcSet":"/static/f781b9da31acbdd9e803759f5c15d290/bf0e2/lost-1.png 750w,\n/static/f781b9da31acbdd9e803759f5c15d290/5695a/lost-1.png 1080w,\n/static/f781b9da31acbdd9e803759f5c15d290/d3afe/lost-1.png 1366w,\n/static/f781b9da31acbdd9e803759f5c15d290/bdec0/lost-1.png 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.3645833333333333}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"the-lost-children"}},
